### The ProblemRecognition class is used for sentiment analysis of headlines in a given set of posts.
# It uses the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
# sentiment analysis tool from NLTK library to compute the polarity scores of headlines,
# and then interpret the scores to assign a label of 1, 0 or -1 to each headline,
# representing positive, neutral or negative sentiment respectively.
# This class also has a method to extract negative posts based on their assigned labels.
